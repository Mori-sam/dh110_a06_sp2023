# DH110 Assignment 06: interface design system
###Yongsen Huang/Spring 2023

##Description of the project
The primary objective of this assignment is to establish a consistent and cohesive design language for the TribeTrack interface, thus enhancing the wireframe and improving the overall user experience. This will involve the creation of design elements such as font, shape, color, and layout, which will be integrated into the interface to provide a coherent and visually appealing design.

The TribeTrack app is designed to help users track the location of family members, create customized geofences, and provide emergency calling functionality. Therefore, the interface will be focused on providing a seamless user experience through simple yet effective interactions and providing the necessary features to achieve the app's objectives. As a result, the app will involve more words and settings interactions than graphic interactions, which will require careful consideration in terms of the design and layout to ensure a clear and concise user interface.
